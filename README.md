# Password Generator

Welcome to the Password Generator! This tool is designed to create secure, customised passwords for your various needs. By specifying the length, special characters, and an associated company name, you can generate a unique password every time.

## Usage

To use the Password Generator, you'll be prompted for the following inputs:

1. **Length of the Password:** You can specify how long the password should be.
2. **Special Characters or Numbers at the End:** You can add an extra layer of complexity by appending special characters or numbers at the end of your password.
3. **Company Name:** Associating your password with a company name helps in generating a more personalised password.

After you provide the inputs, the password generator will start the generation process and provide you with a unique password. Remember, the safety of your password is paramount â€“ never share it with anybody!
